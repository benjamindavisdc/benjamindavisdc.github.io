<ul>
    <li>The adventure is now running on an LLM!</li>
    <li>Premade world context surrounding the adventures of Sir Bumble</li>
    <li>Slight UI improvements</li>
</ul>
    <p>I was working through the AI games course and figured since it was showing me how to generate a game, I may as well connect it to my existing front end! It didn't seem like it would be too hard since all I had to do was change the end point from Gradio to my own site, but it ended up being way more complicated than I expected...
    </p>
    <p>At first I figured I could do a simple AI copy and paste, but quickly discovered I had no idea what I was looking at. So I stepped back and took a few days to read over "NodeJS: From Novice to Ninja", and within a few days I started to learn a few fundamental concepts which helped me to understand routers.</p>

    <ol><h3>I used Vercel for my backend deployment, and immediately ran into multiple problems:</h3>
        <li>I found out Vercel only runs serverless functions, and I had to package all of my code inside of a single function which could run as the default export.</li>
        <li>The code from the course wasn't exactly set up to fetch data from a cloud based file system, so I had to learn how Vercel backend filesystems were structured.</li>
        <li>And I also ran into problems with permissions and the firewal, preventing me from running any tests over the web until it was solved.</li>

    </ol> 
    <p>
        Apparently Vercel has some security features which make it necessary to specify which frontend domains it will accept requests from. I spent a lot of time trying to get that configured. I kept running into errors even though I was following everything from the documentation. After staying up until 3 am I finally realized I had my API key loaded improperly, and once that was fixed, it started working...
    </p>
    <p>
        The next problem I ran into was that Vercel doesn't like to serve static files, so I had to find out how to load my world JSON from my front end server, which required me to make a new function to load and parse the file. That wasn't too different from doing locally, except it now had to be async.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started running into all kinds of problems related to synchronizing my functions. It kept initializing the gamestate before my worldJSON was loading, and when I tried to move it from global scope to function scope, then I wasn't able to pass the values on to the next step.
    </p>
    <p>
        I finally settled on initializing the variable globally, and then just changing its contents as it went along through the different functions. Success!
    </p>
    <p>
        And so Sir Bumble was reborn, free to follow his dreams instead of following a premade path.
