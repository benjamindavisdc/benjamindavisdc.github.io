The prompt input form is the most important element in the page. Since I'm not sending the text to a backend, I had to program each input and response using Javascript. I have a few minigames going simultaneously, as well as the ability to type normal text and have it sent into the text output window.<br>
Figuring out how to input text and have it trigger one of a dozen different conditions was tricky.<br>
<br>
I had a few individual loops and functions but they started to trigger each other and crash the output data, so I ended up using a switch case and had each input from a different button trigger its own function, which uses local variables, so different inputs wont conflict with one another.<br>
<br>
The prompt also triggers the HP system and death window.<br>
Setting up the HP system was really confusing, I kept mixing up elements and element.innerText. After working through 3 different health systems, I managed to get the HP counter working properly.<br>
<br>
The AI gave me the idea to create the takeDamage function, which made it easier for the switch case to track my health no matter what inputs I put in any order.<br>

I was struggling to make the tree burn down if you climb it when burning. My if/else statement kept outputting the wrong values:<br>
<span style= "color: darkred;"><br>
function climbingTheTree(newText){<br>
    if (youreBurning = true){<br>
    outPutText += <span style="color: orange;">`\n\n${newText}\n\nYou begin climbing up the tree, but the fire quickly spreads. Soon you find yourself in the middle of a raging inferno. You see the cat leap to safety as the burning tree collapses around you. You hit the ground like a falling star, praying that it's not your end.\n\nYou take 100 damage.`</span><br>
    takeDamage(100);}<br>
    else{<br>
    outPutText += <span style="color: orange;">`\n\n${newText}\n\nYou climb up and get clawed and fall down.\n\nYou take 30 damage.`</span><br>
    takeDamage(30);<br>
}}<br>
</span><br>
It took me a minute to realize it's because I was using one equals sign instead of three.
