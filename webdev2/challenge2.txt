Updating the backend to talk to my front end was really tough. I started by copying the code that used gradio to a front end, but struggled to understand how to map the endpoints between the backend and my existing website.

It's too sophisticated a problem for chatGPT to do all the heavy lifting, so I had to take a step back and do some reading. I found NodeJS: Novice to Ninja, and within the first few chapters I had a few important insights.

One thing I had been struggling with was working with modules, and not understanding how to export routers. I was trying to wrap all of the routes in a function and export that, but after reading I learned that all routes assigned to a router become a part of that object. So I just needed a single router for the gameStart and the runAction, which I could then export as a default for my backend serverless function.
