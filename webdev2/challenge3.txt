My original intent with making this project was to demo a travel window which would appear when you visit a new city. I wanted to be able to enter a name of a city, and have a popup which shows the city name and state and population, and a description of the city along with a picture.

I definitely think I could do this soon, but it just didn't end up fitting in with some of the other features I added.

My main text entry form is only meant to deal with predetermined inputs, and I have been using a switch case to manage a growing list of inputs. From what I can tell so far, that isn't compatible with entering in a variable to see if it's present in a collection. The AI told me I could use maps or a couple other techniques to make this work, but I am trying to do my best to practice things I have been reading about and actually understand rather than just copying and pasting things from chatGPT.

After a lot of work dissecting my csv file into a collection that could be easily searched, it just didn't seem to fit with my existing infrastructure. It was still good practice.

So for now, I expanded the "dying adventurer" minigame and I will revisit the city screen once I have studied the second half of my textbook.
