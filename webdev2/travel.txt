<p>My feet were sore, the soles of my shoes worn thin from days of endless walking. The water in my canteen had run out hours ago, and the dry earth underfoot seemed to stretch on forever. But I had to keep going. The city I was after, the one I’d heard whispers about, was still so far off—too far to even touch—but it was my only hope.
</p>
<p>Every step I took felt heavier than the last. The road twisted in front of me, disappearing behind hills only to reappear ahead, a never-ending trail that seemed to mock me with how much farther it went. I couldn’t turn back. Not now. I kept my eyes forward, squinting at the horizon, trying to convince myself that the faint shimmer was the city. But every time I thought I saw it, it was just another mirage.
</p>
<p>The wind picked up, dry and sharp, whispering through the grasses at the side of the road. I wiped my brow and forced my legs to keep moving, pushing through the fatigue, the hunger. The city was supposed to be a place of refuge, a place where I could start over, where I could breathe again. But I had no way of knowing if those stories were true.
</p>
<p>As the sky darkened, I barely noticed the changing light, too focused on the road ahead. Then, just as the last rays of sunlight dipped below the horizon, something shifted. The road curved again, and for the first time in days, the view ahead didn’t look like endless miles of empty land. There it was. Rising from the earth like a dream made real—tall buildings, their outlines stark against the night sky.
</p>
<p>I stopped, my breath catching in my throat. The city. I could see it. Finally.</p>
