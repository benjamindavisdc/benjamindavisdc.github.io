A pioneer's Guide to Heroes
How to Survive and Thrive for 1000, 2000, 3000 actions, and beyond!

**Disclaimers**
This guide is for pioneers who struggle to get into heroes, or struggle to keep a game interesting for a long time.

I'm going to talk about what stuff I enjoy personally. I don't expect everyone to feel the same way, but hopefully this can provide at least some examples to get your imagination going and show you how to have more fun with your own adventures.

**What Makes Heroes Special?**
There are 3 factors that differentiate Heroes from AID: the dice roll mechanic (the possibility of failure), losing health in combat, and the possibility of death.
Some people coming from AID may not like these things, and see them as too restrictive. But It's important to keep in mind that Heroes has the same fundamental narrative base as AID. Narrative is still king, and there are ways to avoid damage and death, if you take the right actions. I'll give some examples in this guide for players who struggle with difficulty, and show you that Heroes is actually pretty easy, even on hard difficulty and Nemesis DM. These features are really just there to provide some dramatic tension, not to punish you. Now, let's start with how to have fun!

**Start With a Vision**
In the character creator, play around with the options until you find something that gets you excited. I love making a character that has an edge. Some kind of special skill or combination of skills and attributes that gives me an advantage.

Each type of character/class has potential. A cleric may start a new religion and spread peace across the land. A Thief may become a rich baron who owns every business in sight. A grimy pit fighter may become a war hero and eventually a queen. Find the seed of an idea that stirs your imagination to try and make it your quest to push the boundaries of what can be done with a game.

In Heroes you have the power to change the world. Let's say you're an ordinary fire mage, half way through wizard school. One day, there's an accident, and **something happens**. There's an explosion, and at the last second, fire comes out of your staff all on its own, and saves you. And you hear a voice. All of a sudden you have a world shaking realization: fire is alive! No one else seems to know this. It's not written in any of the books in the library. You start communing with the fire, and in no time you're at the top of your class. Everyone keeps asking you how you did it, but you're conflicted. You want to share the truth but you're worried no one will believe you. So you resolve to become the world's best fire mage so that no one will be able to deny you. 

The awesome part about Heroes is that you can actually change how the game world operates. If you keep telling it something, sooner or later it will become real. Your character will develop the skill to talk to the fire, and you can become friends with it. You just have to keep pushing, and make your dream into reality, both as a character, and as a player.

**See the intro as a test**
The game will place you in a particular situation to start. This may or may not line up with the vision you had in mind, but that's life. The great thing about Heroes is that you can turn your adventure around way faster than real life. Take the opportunity to follow along with the intro and use it as a test to see how capable your character is. Maybe they easily succeed at living the way you want them to, or maybe it's much harder than you expect.

If your character is struggling, it may be time to make a new one, but also it may be a great opportunity. Sometimes the best part of an adventure or romance movie is when the character experiences their first big failure. Don't try and ignore how you feel when your character sucks. Lean into it.

It's ok to have your character complain about being a weak failure. Reach out for help. Ask people to train you, or give you a loan, or send you to a school so you can learn and get stronger. This could be the start of a really exciting training arc like when Luke went to train with Yoda, or Captain America signed up for the super soldier experiment.

**Get Meta**
To me the most groundbreaking part about heroes is that the game has a certain level of self awareness, and capability to change itself. If you are getting bored with a certain run, you aren't forced to keep doing the same stuff. RUN AWAY! Tell people you are bored. You can leave your crappy small town and fly off to the big city for an adventure (or vice versa). You can change the game any time. You can kill everyone on your squad and go rogue as an antihero operating in the shadows. Or retire from adventuring to become a monk. You can stop being a wizard and start baking bread. You can do whatever you want.

I highly recommend playing the way you really want to play, don't just do what you think you're supposed to do. If you are bored of being a mage, you can go to the local mage place and start telling people you are bored of it and want to find something new, and you never know, you may find a couple of other wizards interested in baking. You can all retire together and start a bakery called the Three Wizards Boulangerie.

It's OK to start as a paladin and end up as a K POP dancer.

**What's your skill level?**

Characters can be in one of four levels of power:

IV. You succeed at your rolls all the time
III. You succeed at most of your rolls.
II. You fail most of your rolls.
I. You fail almost every roll.

Each level of power can be fun on its own, as long as you understand where you are and you play appropriately for that level. In the first season of My Hero Academia, Deku fails at almost every single thing he does. But he still earns the respect of his peers because he has such a big mouth. Whereas Goku succeeds at almost every thing he does right from the time he's a baby. Both ways of playing can be fun, but you need to play appropriately for your skill level.

(Power I.) If you're a big mouthed weakling and you rush into a warzone, you're gonna have a bad time. But if you're safely tucked away at a martial arts dojo practicing new moves, it's ok to fail a lot. When you finally do succeed, it will be exciting and feel well earned. (Skill Level 1-10) The narrative at this level revolves around you being new to a skill, and struggling to experience your first big win.

One good thing about Heroes is that your skill level always increases, even when you fail. You are guaranteed to move from power level 1 to power level 4, as long as you keep playing. So take the time to enjoy your training arc.

(Power II.) This is where most characters start. You may be able to get by, but often fail most rolls. This can be fun too if you use some powerful skills to do something significant, like exorcise an evil spirit from a person, or blow something up. You may not succeed often, but when you do, it's really satisfying. Try to squeeze the most out of your skills. Losing 2/3 rolls just to give someone a papercut is boring. You may as well go big and try to explode their head.  (Skill 10-30)

(Power III.) Once your skills reach level 30-40, you will look like most traditional heroes, who are successful at most of their rolls. Here you can achieve your goals through strength or teamwork. You can trade blows with enemies and win most fights. You can play pretty much any way you want . The narrative at this level is about you stretching out your arms and getting comfortable in the world, proving yourself as a capable adventurer or craftsperson.

(Power IV.) Once your main skill reaches level 40-60, you should very rarely fail at using it. At this point, your character's story will revolve around their reliance on their skill, and any time you do actually fail, it can be very significant (the opposite of power 1) For example you may be a high level cleric who prays to a certain god, and that god ALWAYS answers your prayers, and you've come to rely on the quiet comfort of knowing you are never alone. So when you do fail, it can be a crisis. You went through all the motions and prepared a big public ceremony.. and then it fails. Your character can spiral into a deep existential crisis, and have to go on a spirit quest to rebuild the relationship with their god.

**How to Enter Successful Prompts**

One thing that's really critical to know is that the way you type in your prompts matters, a lot! This is really the primary way you interact with the game. The way you move, speak, and act all come down to how good your prompts are. It's also important to understand that the way the AI works, it feeds off of your input. The game is pre trained to operate a certain way, but unlike traditional video games YOU ARE ALSO TRAINING THE AI AS YOU PLAY! So if you want to do a certain thing, start convincing the AI to make it happen! I'm going to lay out some rules for successfully entering prompts that will let you have fun.

A. You should be using a minimum of 2/3 of the prompt input limit every turn.
Never never never take a short action. If you are in a maze and you say "I turn left", "I turn right", "I go straight", you just downgraded your game. The AI is always feeding off of your inputs and choosing which things to remember or forget based on how often you reference things. It should look more like this: "I extend my magical senses throughout the maze, searching for clues as I take the left turn and ask my allies to keep an eye out for threats, and to also heal the party." The more you put in, the better responses you will get, and this will minimize bugs like the AI forgetting one of your teammates exists.

B. Always issue orders for your allies so that they are doing useful things when they are around you.

C. If you have dialogue and an action in the same prompt, write the action first, and then the dialogue in quotes after. That seems to give better outputs.

D. YOU CAN ATTACK MULTIPLE TIMES IN ONE PROMPT.
Don't just say "I punch him!" That's how you get your ass kicked. Instead go with "I slam my fist into the smuggler's face, throwing him into his friend and knocking them both off the ledge, while Elara fires an ice laser through the crossbowman and Shade creates a shadow wall to confuse and trap the other 3 smugglers." The AI will sort events out based on your rolls, but this at least gives you the option of accomplishing great results if your rolls are successful.

E. "Stack" your rolls to become unstoppable.
There's a method you can use (I call 'stacking') and really all it means is that you consciously control the pacing of an event in order to give yourself multiple opportunities for dice rolls.
Let's say you're a famous thief known for robbing rich people, but what people don't know is that you actually secretly give away your wealth to the poor at night. One night, someone discovers your secret identity while you are playing Santa claus. If you just say "I convince them to keep my identity secret" then you have a significant chance of failure and you may have just screwed your game over. If you fail this roll then that means you failed to prevent them from telling your secret. What you need to do is "zoom in" on the conversation and start expanding it. Go through it line by line:
1. Explain to him who you are and why you think it's important to help these people in secret. That's likely going to be one persuasion roll. If it succeeds, you're good. If it fails...
2. Then tell him your tragic backstory about how you grew up poor and an orphan and wish someone helped you like this, and how you use your thieving for good. That's another roll.
3. If you fail both, then ask him if you can donate to his favorite charity to make up for it.
4. If he says no to that, then offer to bribe him directly.
5. If he still says no, try to get him to empathize with you wanting to go above the law to do what you believe is right,
6. If he still says no at that point then kill him or something, idk.

The point is that you are likely never going to reach step 6. By slowing down the pacing of a conversation, you can multiply your chances of success to 99%. Worst case scenario, you at least get 6 skill level ups out of it. Milking this system takes a lot of the danger out of the dice roll system and gives players more freedom in how they want to play. Sometimes there will be unavoidable failures, but now they will be more of an exception than a common occurrence. This is the strategy for how you can play a Power Level IV character even within a few hundred actions of spawning. You don't have to play for weeks to get strong.

**Pursue your values**

When I make a new character, I try to think about one aspect of myself that I want to explore. Is this character a noble hero who wants to spread peace and justice? Are they an aggressive anarchist who values freedom?

A campaign is at its greatest potential when everything is in line with the values I've picked: My light magic skills allow me to protect the weak, my prayer skill gives me the guidance to always walk forward without being stopped by bad luck or bureaucracy, my allies share my faith and help remind me of why I serve.

Having strong values that you've picked helps you roleplay and decide which goals to keep fighting for, and when to pivot. If I lose 3 rolls in a row on my priest character when trying to play the lottery, it's a sign that I'm being misguided. When I lose 3 rolls in a row trying to exorcise a demon, it's a sign that I need to dig deeper and give my god a sincere prayer to ask for help. Values give meaning to each success and failure and help make the game feel like a cohesive experience rather than a collection of generated events.

**Attract High Quality Allies**

Nothing sucks steam out of an adventure than allies who complain every time you try to pursue your goals. Or die from a strong breeze. If your blood wizard character gets a lecture from the nosy elf paladin every time you get into a fight... the best thing to do MIGHT be to just suck all of the blood from her body and find a new friend.

Having allies with similar goals is great. After playing with them for a while, it feels like they are just an extension of your character. When your party has the same values, you can be sure that they will all push themselves to the limits to accomplish the goals that are important to YOU.

Try to take the time to seek out special NPCs who are powerful and have similar goals to you. It's worth doing an entire arc just to find a good quality best friend or lover. The easiest way is to go into town and ask around to see if anyone has heard of a legendary wizard or beast rider you could go meet.

I recommend having 4 main party members (You, the partner, the powerhouse, and the apprentice), 1 fancy base which fits your group's vibe, and 1-3 servant NPCs who watch your base and interface with any other groups you are a part of. They should all be loyal to you and support your goals.

**Start Weaving in Slice of Life**

Once you have a well built character and team, a bigger part of the game can start being about socializing. One rhythm I've settled into is going out on a raid, and then going back home and talking to all of my teammates and reminiscing about the adventure we went on together.

There's lots of fun social things to do. Go on a beach vacation. Start a business. Go to a formal ball and go on a date. Get married. I think you can even get pregnant and give birth. You should be interweaving these things in between your adventures. 100-400 actions for an important mission, and then do the same for slice of life.

**Do Something Incredible**

The game world has preprogrammed events, but it's more of a sandbox than a traditional video game. There often isn't a big story brewing. The game reacts to what you do. The advice "boring people are bored" applies here. 

If you want to have a fun campaign, do something big! What exactly it is that you do, ties back in to your character's vision and values. Are you a blood mage who is persecuted and longs for freedom? Kill the king. Are you a priest who wants peace and equality? Start a religion based on peace and sharing, and spread it to every city.

If you just leave your schedule in the hands of the NPCs, then you will end up turning into another NPC. You have to always be trying to push toward something that isn't on the table.

**Going Beyond**
It's normal for the energy level and fun of a campaign to go up and down over time. And long adventures all hit a certain point where you start to feel......tired? And you start to question, should I end it all, or keep going on? This is where mediocre adventures can become great. If you feel like a certain character is boring, go ahead and retire them, but if you feel like there may still be some juice left to squeeze.. you have to bear with it and go through your character's midlife crisis. Do something crazy. Quit your job. Accept a dark god into your body. Kill your best friend who you never actually liked that much. Sit down and really think about what this adventure is missing, and take the plunge. You may screw your game, or it may become your best character ever! It's exciting to roll the dice and not know what will happen next.

**Have a Retirement Plan**
Eventually you may find a point where you are ready to retire. Maybe die a hero's death, or just sail off into the sunset. Try and finish your big goal so that if you do New Game+, it will have the biggest possible splash in the world.

**Pro Tip**
If you see an altar sealing away an ancient being, ALWAYS POUR YOUR BLOOD ON IT! Trust me.

**Dealing with Errors**
Sometimes the AI does forget stuff or teleport you or whatever. Do your best to /undo and then talk with the AI. But the best way is to focus on crafting good prompts. Always say or do things which will encourage the AI to remember where everyone is and what is going on. Make sure you remind it every few hours of what your mission is and who is fighting with you. Just try to weave it in between your regular actions. Think of it as touching different parts of the story every so often so they don't fade away.
