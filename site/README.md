# Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates a pipeline setup using Jenkins to deploy a website to an Apache server.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Clones the website repository from GitHub.
2. Executes build and test processes using Jenkins.
3. Copies the built website files to an Apache server.
4. Deploys the website, making it accessible on the web.

## Prerequisites

To use this pipeline project, you'll need the following:

- Jenkins installed and configured.
- An Apache server for hosting the website.
- Git installed on the Jenkins server.
- Access to the website repository on GitHub.

## Pipeline Configuration

1. Set up a Jenkins job with the following pipeline stages:
   - **Clone Repository**: Clone the website repository from GitHub.
   - **Build and Test**: Execute the build and test processes.
   - **Copy to Apache Server**: Copy the built website files to the Apache server.
   - **Deployment**: Deploy the website on the Apache server.

2. Configure the necessary credentials in Jenkins to access the website repository and the Apache server.

3. Enable a GitHub webhook on your repository to trigger the Jenkins pipeline automatically whenever changes are pushed.

4. Update the Jenkinsfile in your pipeline job with the appropriate configurations, such as repository URL, file paths, and deployment settings.

## Usage

1. Make changes to the website code and push them to the GitHub repository.

2. The GitHub webhook will automatically trigger the Jenkins pipeline, initiating the build and deployment process.

3. Monitor the Jenkins job console output to track the progress of each pipeline stage.

4. Once the pipeline completes successfully, the updated website will be deployed to the Apache server and accessible on the web.
