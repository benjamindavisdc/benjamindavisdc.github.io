I spent quite a bit of time trying to make it to where the most recent action was highlighted in gold. <br>
<br><span style= "color:gold">
const lines = data.split('\n');<br>
                const lastLine = lines[lines.length-1];<br>
                //splitting and modifying data streams is brain melting work<br>
                game.innerHTML = game.innerHTML.replace(lastLine, `<span class="last-line">${lastLine}</span>`);<br>
                //YOU HAVE TO USE `BACK TICKS` when using replace!!<br>
<br></span>
I could make the initial paragraph end in gold.<br>
<br>
But then every successive input stayed gold, because the <span> tag was baked into the old actions.<br>
<br>
The only solution I could manage required regenerating the entire text block every action to render the gold color. That seemed like it would get intensive for a large text file like AID, so I scrapped that feature. <br>
