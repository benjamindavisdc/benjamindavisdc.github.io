        This site is to help me learn and show my skills with Javascript. I came up with all the design concepts myself, and have limited myself to using only code that I've read about in my textbook, with only a couple of exceptions. I've primarily focused on learning the DOM, and event handling. Being able to manipulate modals and text outputs has been very exciting, it's way more fun than the static sites I have built in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
    Creating the main text output window and the form input was the first thing I did. It gradually became more complex as I wanted it to accept a greater variety of text inputs. It appends text, summons the <s>travel screen and</s> death screen, and manipulates the character's HP. My if/else loops were becoming pretty unweildy so I changed the prompt processing code to a single switch case where each outcome ran a unique function. For the HP system, I created a custom function for each type of task your character can (unsuccessfully) attempt, as well as a takeDamage function which any of them can call on. This greatly simplified the prompt input functionality and made it feel much more modular.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am still struggling with loops and arrays, so a lot of my code is repeated (9 listeners for closing modals, 9 for showing) so my next step will be to refactor my code to be more concise and dynamic once I have read over the rest of the chapters for creating collections and looping over them.
