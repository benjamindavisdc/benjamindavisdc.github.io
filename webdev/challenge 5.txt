Challenge #5
Multiple Modals

This was my first time creating modals, which was very exciting. Setting them up wasn't too hard, but what really ended up driving me crazy was figuring out how to get them to close.

I originally was expecting to be able to use the same close button for each modal, but I couldn't figure out how to get the event listener to work to hide more than the individual modal it was targeting, so I was forced to copy and paste 7 identical close buttons.

I knew this wasn't ideal but I at least wanted to get a prototype working before I tried implimenting some type of advanced workaround.

To my surprise, I couldn't close any but the first modal. I tried all kinds of things, alternating between getElementById, querySelector, and querySelectorAll, and nothing seemed to work.

Finally I consulted the AI and realized that I still had been reusing the same Id for each button, which is why only the first one was working. Once I gave them unique Ids, then I was able to make the close button work. I had to go through a similar process with the "click-away" feature of the modal. Each screen needed a separate event listener targeting each appropriate modal. So my code ended up looking very repetitive with 9 modals, 9 close button listeners, 9 click away listeners.

I knew there had to be a better way to make the code more dynamic, but I couldn't figure out a way to get the close listeners to dynamically get the appropriate IDs. So I moved on with my prototype and kept reading my book during the day.
