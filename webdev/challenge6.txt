The prompt input form is the most important element in the page. Since I'm not sending the text to a backend, I had to program each input and response using Javascript. I have a few minigames going simultaneously, as well as the ability to type normal text and have it sent into the text output window.
Figuring out how to input text and have it trigger one of a dozen different conditions was tricky.

I had a few individual loops and functions but they started to trigger each other and crash the output data, so I ended up using a switch case and had each input from a different button trigger its own function, which uses local variables, so different inputs wont conflict with one another.

The prompt also triggers the HP system and death window.
Setting up the HP system was really confusing, I kept mixing up elements and element.innerText. After working through 3 different health systems, I managed to get the HP counter working properly.

The AI gave me the idea to create the takeDamage function, which made it easier for the switch case to track my health no matter what inputs I put in any order.
